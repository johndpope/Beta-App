# Probo Rules and Requirements

## Requirements for all probo levels

- Submit study hours every week using the app. Late hours will ***NOT*** be tolerated!
- You must meet with the `Wellness Committee` **twice** this semester. It is ***your perogative*** to schedule them. Contact John Brock (`brock15@purdue.edu`) to schedule your meetings. 
	- Meetings ***must*** be at least **6 weeks apart**. You should take theses meetings seriously, a lot of brothers in this house have mental health issues, so I *truly* believe that it can be helpful to talk to the wellness committee!
- You are expected to come to ***biweekly meetings*** after chapter each week. These meetings should only be `15-30 mins`. There will be a different topic each week (for example, goal setting will be the first topic).
	- The first meeting will be on `January 14th` (the first chapter).
	- Finally you are expected to **schedule and meet** with someone on the `scholarship committee` after your *first* and *second* rounds of exams. These grade checks will allow you to move up ***a single*** probo level.


> If these requirements are not met, you will be subect to the **punishments** listed below.

## How to get study hours

- You must have a signature from one of the following for your hours to count:
	- A brother ***NOT*** on probo
	- SI session leader
	- TA office hours
- There will be ***silent*** study hours at the house in the `second floor study` from `8 pm - 12 am, Mon - Fri`.
	- Silence means you are not play your music out loud (stants). It also means yoo're not talking to your friends. Pretty simple concept!
- This semester there will also be study hours in `RAWL`. We can't always get the same room, but it will always be somewhere on the `first floor`, from `6 pm - 12 am`. I will post the rooms for each day [here]().

## Punishments

- There will be no leniency this semester, if you miss a deadline, you will be punishe!

- If you don't get your study hours in for the week, you will be fined $10.
	- This will increase by $10 for each consecutive week.

- If you don't get your calendar in by `January 19th`, I will add an hour to your required hours for the rest of the semester every day you're late.

- If you miss our meetings without texting me a valid excuse **24 HOURS IN ADVANCE** you will owe me `2` extra study hours that week

- If you don't meet with the `Wellness Committee` at least twice during the semester, you will be fined $10 for each meeting that you didn't have.

- If you do not meet with someone on the scholarship committee to do grade checks after the first and second rounds of exams, you will be *effectively* moved down a probo level and you will **NOT** be allowed to go to formal until you check your grades, so just check your grades!
