# Progress for 12/16/17

Today I spent a lot of time looking at iOS/Swift courses from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). The `Swift for Developers` course taught me enough to know how to work with variables in Swift. The `How to Make an iOS App` course taught me how to plan for my app and I created sketches of my interface which I will have below. The `Auto Layout` course taught me how to use `Stack Views` to manipulate views to fit an sized screen.
